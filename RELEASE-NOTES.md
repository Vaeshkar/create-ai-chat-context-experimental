# 📦 Release Notes

## Version 3.2.0

**Release Date:** October 26, 2025

### 🎉 What's New in v3.2.0

This release adds **universal AI rules** that work across all LLM platforms, comprehensive **unit test coverage** for consolidation agents, and significant **repository cleanup**.

### ✨ Features

#### 1. 🌍 Universal AI Rules (`.ai/rules/`)

**NEW:** AI rules now work across **all LLM platforms**, not just Augment!

- ✅ **`.ai/rules/`** - Universal rules folder (works for Claude, Cursor, Warp, Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.)
- ✅ **`.augment/rules/`** - Pointer file for Augment (auto-loads universal rules)
- ✅ **`.ai/README.md`** - Instructions for AI assistants and users
- ✅ **3 core rules:**
  - `always-load-context.md` - Context loading instructions
  - `cleanup-after-completion.md` - Planning doc cleanup rules
  - `protected-ai-files.md` - File protection rules

**Platform Support:**

- **Augment:** Automatic (reads `.augment/rules/always-load-context.md`)
- **Cursor:** Add to `.cursorrules`: "Load .ai/rules/ before every task"
- **Warp:** Add to `warp.md`: "Read .ai/rules/ at session start"
- **Claude/Copilot/ChatGPT:** User says: "Read .ai/rules/ first"

#### 2. 🧪 Unit Test Coverage for Consolidation Agents

**NEW:** Added 36 comprehensive unit tests for critical pipeline agents!

- ✅ **CacheConsolidationAgent** (10 tests)
  - Chunk processing from multiple platforms
  - Deduplication logic
  - Invalid JSON handling
  - Multi-platform support (Augment + Claude)

- ✅ **SessionConsolidationAgent** (12 tests)
  - Session grouping by date
  - AICF format parsing
  - Storage/token reduction calculation
  - Large file handling (100+ conversations)

- ✅ **MemoryDropoffAgent** (14 tests)
  - Age-based dropoff (0-2, 2-7, 7-14, 14+ days)
  - Folder management (sessions/medium/old/archive)
  - Compression tracking
  - Multiple session handling

**Test Results:**

- ✅ **624 tests passing** (25 skipped)
- ✅ No regressions
- ✅ All agents now have proper test coverage

#### 3. 🧹 Repository Cleanup

**IMPROVED:** Cleaner, more organized repository structure!

- ✅ Moved 12 architecture/design docs from root → `docs/`
- ✅ Deleted 5 manual test scripts from root
- ✅ Root now has only **4 essential .md files**:
  - `README.md`
  - `PRIVACY.md`
  - `SECURITY.md`
  - `RELEASE-NOTES.md`
- ✅ Added `.test-tmp/` to `.gitignore`

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- ✅ Fixed `.ai/rules/` support in `MigrateCommand`
- ✅ Fixed `.ai/rules/` support in `InitCommand`
- ✅ Both commands now properly copy universal rules during setup

## Version 3.0.0

**Release Date:** October 24, 2025

### 🎉 What's New in v3.0.0

This is the **first stable release** of the experimental memory consolidation system. All features are production-ready with comprehensive privacy and security documentation.

---

## ✨ Major Features

### 1. 🔐 Explicit Consent & Permission Management

**NEW:** Users now explicitly grant permission for each LLM platform before data access.

```bash
# View all permissions
aice permissions list

# Revoke access to a platform
aice permissions revoke warp

# Grant access to a platform
aice permissions grant warp
```

**Features:**

- ✅ Explicit opt-in for each platform
- ✅ Revoke access anytime
- ✅ Complete audit trail in `.aicf/.permissions.aicf`
- ✅ Timestamps for all permission changes

### 2. 📋 Comprehensive Documentation

**NEW:** Three bulletproof documentation files:

- **[PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md)** - Privacy policy & data handling
- **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)** - Security architecture & audit logging
- **[CLI-COMMANDS.md](CLI-COMMANDS.md)** - Complete command reference

### 3. ⏰ Correct Polling Interval

**FIXED:** System now polls every 5 minutes (300000ms) instead of 5 seconds.

- ✅ Reduced system load
- ✅ Respects user's machine resources
- ✅ Configurable via `--interval` flag

### 4. 🎯 Transparent Data Flow

**NEW:** Clear messaging about what data is accessed and why.

```
🔐 Conversation Capture Mode

📁 Data Discovery
To set up automatic mode, we need your permission to:
  • Read conversations from your LLM library folders
  • Extract and consolidate them into memory files
  • Store them locally in .aicf/ and .ai/ directories
```
