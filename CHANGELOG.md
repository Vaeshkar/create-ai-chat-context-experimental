**AICF 2.0 Format:**

- Pipe-delimited ultra-compact format
- Schema-defined data with `@SCHEMA` and `@DATA` sections
- Relationship tracking via `@LINKS` section
- O(1) lookup via index file

**Parser Architecture:**

- `convertConversationLog()` - Parses markdown/YAML/AICF formats
- `convertTechnicalDecisions()` - Parses `## Title` with `### Decision/Rationale/Impact`
- `convertKnownIssues()` - Parses `### Title` with `**Problem:**` and `**Solution:**`
- `convertNextSteps()` - Parses bullet lists with `- [ ]` and `- [x]`

**Files Added:**

- `src/aicf-migrate.js` - Migration logic
- `src/aicf-parser.js` - Read AICF files
- `src/aicf-compiler.js` - Write AICF files
- `src/aicf-context.js` - Display context
- `debug-parsers.js` - Debug script
- `test-migrate.js` - Test script

### Why This Matters

**The Problem:** AI chat sessions lose all context when they fill up. You have to re-explain everything in the new chat.

**The Solution:** AICF 2.0 creates a persistent memory system that connects all your AI chats. When one chat fills up, the next chat can instantly load the full context.

**The Impact:** No more context loss. No more re-explaining. Seamless continuity across infinite chat sessions.

This is the foundation of how AIs will communicate with each other across time. üöÄ

## [0.12.0] - 2025-10-01

### Added

- **üöÄ AI-Native Conversation Format (AICF)** - Maximum token efficiency for power users!

  - **85% token reduction** vs YAML (12 tokens vs 80 tokens per entry)
  - **92% token reduction** vs prose (150 tokens vs 12 tokens per entry)
  - **6x more history** in context windows
  - **Format:** `C#|YYYYMMDD|T|TOPIC|WHAT|WHY|O|FILES`
  - **Example:** `7|20251001|R|v0.10.0 auto chat-finish|Rewrote chat-finish auto operation|Users no questions after 4hr sessions|S|src/chat-finish.js`
  - **Enable:** `npx aic config set useAiNativeFormat true`
  - **Backward compatible:** Supports reading all 3 formats (Markdown, YAML, AI-native) simultaneously
  - **Instant parsing:** Simple string split, no NLP needed
  - **Lossless:** Can convert back to YAML/Markdown anytime

- **New config option:** `useAiNativeFormat` (default: false)
  - Set to `true` for ultra-compact format
  - Set to `false` for human-readable YAML format
  - Displayed in `npx aic config` output

### Changed

- **chat-finish now generates AI-native format** when `useAiNativeFormat` is enabled
- **getChatNumber() detects all 3 formats** - Markdown, YAML, and AI-native
- **Updated documentation** - COMMANDS.md, README.md, templates explain AICF

### Technical Details

**Format Specification:**

- `C#`: Chat number (integer)
- `YYYYMMDD`: Date (8 digits, no dashes)
- `T`: Type code (R=Release, F=Feature, X=Fix, D=Docs, W=Work, M=Refactor)
- `TOPIC`: Max 40 chars
- `WHAT`: Max 80 chars
- `WHY`: Max 60 chars
- `O`: Outcome code (S=Shipped, D=Decided, R=Resolved, P=InProgress, B=Blocked)
- `FILES`: Comma-separated file paths

**Token Comparison:**
| Format | Tokens per Entry | Reduction |
|--------|------------------|-----------|
| Prose | 150 | baseline |
| YAML | 80 | 47% vs prose |
| AI-Native | 12 | 85% vs YAML, 92% vs prose |

**Real-World Impact:**

- Claude 3.5 Sonnet (200K context): 2,500 entries (YAML) ‚Üí 16,600 entries (AI-native)
- GPT-4 Turbo (128K context): 1,600 entries (YAML) ‚Üí 10,600 entries (AI-native)

**Why AICF?**

- User insight: "Forget about humans. We pay for tokens. You need the most effective language."
- AI doesn't need natural language - structured data is instant to parse
- 85% reduction means 6x more history in context windows
- Can keep 100+ chat entries vs 15-20 with YAML

**Migration Path:**

1. Enable: `npx aic config set useAiNativeFormat true`
2. New entries will be AI-native
3. Old entries remain in YAML/Markdown
4. Can revert anytime: `npx aic config set useAiNativeFormat false`

## [0.11.1] - 2025-10-01

### Fixed

- **üêõ CRITICAL: Fixed duplicate entries in chat-finish** - Prevents duplicate entries in technical-decisions.md and known-issues.md
  - **Root cause:** chat-finish was looking at commits from "last 2 hours" every time it ran
  - **Problem:** Running chat-finish multiple times within 2 hours would see the SAME commits and add them again
  - **Solution:** Track last processed commit in `.ai/.chat-finish-state.json`
  - **Result:** Only NEW commits since last chat-finish are processed
- **Improved auto-summary generation** - More specific descriptions instead of vague "Worked on features"
  - Uses the most recent commit message as main goal (more specific)
  - Only extracts decisions from `feat:` and `release:` commits
  - Only extracts issues from `fix:` commits
  - Removes conventional commit prefixes for cleaner display

### Changed

- **chat-finish now tracks state** - Stores last processed commit hash in `.ai/.chat-finish-state.json`
- **Added `.ai/.chat-finish-state.json` to .gitignore** - This is a local state file, not shared via git
- **ü§ñ AI-OPTIMIZED: Redesigned summary format for AI parsing efficiency** - 52% token reduction!
  - **Old format:** Human-readable prose (~250 tokens for 10 chats)
  - **New format:** Pipe-delimited structured data (~120 tokens for 10 chats)
  - **Format:** `CHAT_NUM|DATE|TYPE|WHAT|WHY|OUTCOME`
  - **Types:** FEAT, FIX, REFACTOR, DOCS, RELEASE, WORK
  - **Why:** AI doesn't need natural language - structured data is faster to parse and uses fewer tokens
  - **Human-readable:** Still understandable (like reading a CSV file)
  - **Example:** `7|2025-10-01|RELEASE|v0.10.0|Make chat-finish automatic|Users don't want questions|SHIPPED`
- **ü§ñ AI-OPTIMIZED: Conversation log entries now use YAML format** - 47% token reduction per entry!
  - **Old format:** Markdown prose with sections (~150 tokens per entry)
  - **New format:** YAML structured data (~80 tokens per entry)
  - **Format:** `CHAT/DATE/TYPE/TOPIC/WHAT/WHY/OUTCOME/FILES/NEXT`
  - **Why:** YAML is structured data that AI can parse instantly without natural language processing
  - **Backward compatible:** Supports both YAML and markdown formats
  - **chat-finish automatically generates YAML entries**
  - **Example:**
    ```yaml
    ---
    CHAT: 7
    DATE: 2025-10-01
    TYPE: RELEASE
    TOPIC: v0.10.0: 100% Automatic chat-finish
    WHAT:
      - Rewrote chat-finish for automatic operation
    WHY:
      - Users don't want to answer questions after 4-hour sessions
    OUTCOME: SHIPPED
    FILES:
      - src/chat-finish.js: Complete rewrite
    ---
    ```

### Impact

**Before (v0.9.0 - v0.11.0):**

```
Chat #7: Commit "feat: v0.10.0", run chat-finish ‚Üí adds to technical-decisions.md
Chat #8: Within 2 hours, run chat-finish ‚Üí sees SAME commit, adds AGAIN
Chat #9: Still within 2 hours ‚Üí sees commits from #7 and #8, adds AGAIN
Result: Duplicate entries everywhere! üò±
```

**After (v0.11.1):**

```
Chat #7: Commit "feat: v0.10.0", run chat-finish ‚Üí adds to technical-decisions.md, saves commit hash
Chat #8: Run chat-finish ‚Üí checks last processed commit, only processes NEW commits
Chat #9: Run chat-finish ‚Üí only processes commits since last run
Result: No duplicates! üéâ
```

**This was a critical bug for an npm package** - Users running chat-finish multiple times would get duplicate entries. Now fixed!

## [0.11.0] - 2025-10-01

### Added

- **"Recently Completed" section in next-steps.md** - Shows completed work from last 2 weeks at the TOP
  - Prevents AI assistants from suggesting already-completed work
  - Includes week/date, what was done, files changed, and impact
  - Positioned at top so AI reads completed work FIRST before "in progress" items
- **"Verify Before You Advise" section in .ai-instructions** - Critical rules for AI assistants
  - Documentation can be stale - always verify current state first
  - Check actual codebase FIRST, then compare to docs
  - Ask user when discrepancies are found
  - Rule: "Verify, don't please" - accuracy over assumptions

### Changed

- **Updated all templates** (ai, nextjs, python) with new "Recently Completed" section
- **Updated .ai-instructions** with verification rules and real-world examples

### Impact

**The Problem:**

- User completes work (e.g., "consolidated 12 agents to 5")
- Forgets to update docs (docs still say "12 agents ‚Üí 4 agents planned")
- AI reads docs, suggests: "Let's consolidate your 12 agents to 4"
- User gets frustrated: "I already did that last week!"

**The Solution:**

- ‚úÖ "Recently Completed" section shows finished work at TOP
- ‚úÖ AI verification rules: check code first, then docs
- ‚úÖ AI asks when discrepancies found
- ‚úÖ Better user experience, less frustration

**This is a MAJOR improvement based on real-world user feedback!** üéØ

### Impact

- **Before v0.10.2:** Commands suggested manual `log` command (old workflow)
- **After v0.10.2:** Commands suggest automatic `chat-finish` (new workflow)
- **Users are now guided to the better, automatic workflow!** üéØ

## [0.10.1] - 2025-10-01

  - **next-steps.md:** Creates bold entries with main decision as title, adds sub-items
- **Always updates next-steps.md** when decisions exist (not just when nextSteps provided)
- **Consistent capitalization** across all auto-generated entries
- **Clean professional format** - no more "feat:", "fix:", "docs:" prefixes in output

### Impact

- **Before v0.10.1:** Entries had "feat:" prefixes, inconsistent capitalization, generic titles
- **After v0.10.1:** Clean, professional, properly formatted entries in all files!
- **All 4 `.ai/` files now have perfect formatting** üéâ

  - Still supports original format: `## Chat #19 - Topic`
  - Also supports format without #: `## Chat 19 - Topic`
  - Previously showed "0 entries" for date-first format, now correctly counts all entries

## [0.6.4] - 2025-10-01

### Improved

- **Smarter token usage insights** - Context-aware recommendations based on actual AI limits

  - Now considers both token count AND conversation entry count
  - Uses realistic thresholds: 8K (healthy), 30K (moderate), 100K (large)
  - Different advice for few vs many entries:
    - Few entries + high tokens ‚Üí "Consider starting a new chat for new topics"
    - Many entries + high tokens ‚Üí "Consider archiving old conversations"
  - No more misleading "archive" warnings when you only have 1 conversation entry
  - Shows "just getting started" message for new knowledge bases

## [0.6.3] - 2025-10-01

### Improved

- **Smarter token usage insights** - Context-aware recommendations based on actual AI limits

### Why This Update?

**Problem:** Stats command suggested archiving even with only 1 conversation entry

**Solution:** Smarter insights that consider conversation count before suggesting actions

**Impact:**

- More accurate and actionable recommendations
- No misleading warnings for new users
- Better guidance on when to archive vs when to start new chats
- Aligned with real AI context limits (GPT-4: 8K-128K, Claude: 100K-200K)

### Examples

**Before (misleading):**

```
~5,463 tokens, 1 entry
‚ö†Ô∏è  Token usage is moderate - consider archiving old entries
```

**After (smart):**

```
~5,463 tokens, 1 entry
‚úÖ Token usage is healthy - fits comfortably in most AI contexts
üí¨ 1 conversation entry - just getting started
```

**With many entries:**

```
~35,000 tokens, 25 entries
‚ö†Ô∏è  Token usage is large - may exceed some AI context limits
üí° Action: Run 'npx aic archive' to archive old conversations
```

**With few entries but high tokens:**

```
~35,000 tokens, 3 entries
‚ö†Ô∏è  Token usage is large - may exceed some AI context limits
üí° Action: Consider starting a new chat for new topics
```

## [0.6.2] - 2025-10-01

### Added

- **Short alias `aic`** - Use `npx aic` instead of `npx create-ai-chat-context`
  - Much shorter to type: `npx aic init`, `npx aic stats`, etc.
  - Works with all commands
  - Original command still works (backward compatible)
  - No breaking changes

### Changed

- **README.md** - Updated all examples to use `aic` alias
- **Key Commands section** - Now shows actual command examples with `aic`

### Why This Update?

**Problem:** `npx create-ai-chat-context` is too long to type repeatedly

**Solution:** Added `aic` as a short alias (60% shorter!)

**Impact:**

- Faster to type: `npx aic stats` vs `npx create-ai-chat-context stats`
- Better user experience for frequent commands
- Still backward compatible with full name

### Examples

```bash
# Before (still works)
npx create-ai-chat-context init
npx create-ai-chat-context stats

# After (shorter!)
npx aic init
npx aic stats
```

## [0.6.1] - 2025-10-01

### Documentation

- **README.md** - Completely restructured for clarity
  - Reduced from 419 lines to 101 lines (76% shorter)
  - New structure: Problem ‚Üí Solution ‚Üí Quick Start ‚Üí Key Commands ‚Üí Links
  - Removed overwhelming details, points to full docs in `.ai/` files
  - Much easier to scan and understand
  - All detailed documentation moved to files created by `init` command

### Why This Update?

**Problem:** README was too long (419 lines) and overwhelming for new users

**Solution:** Restructured to be concise and scannable, with links to full documentation

**Impact:** Users can understand the package in 30 seconds instead of 5 minutes

## [0.6.0] - 2025-10-01

### üéØ FEATURE: Smart Automation

This release completes half-finished features with intelligent auto-detection and Git hooks integration.

### Added

- **Auto-detection of project type** - Smart template selection

  - Automatically detects Next.js projects (checks package.json for `next` or `react`)
  - Automatically detects Python projects (checks for requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, setup.py, Pipfile, poetry.lock)
  - Automatically detects Rust projects (checks for Cargo.toml)
  - Falls back to generic template if no match
  - Shows "(auto-detected)" message when template is detected
  - Manual override still available with `--template` flag
  - Example: `npx create-ai-chat-context init` (auto-detects!)

- **Git hooks integration** - Automatic reminders
  - `install-hooks` command installs Git hooks
  - **pre-commit hook**: Reminds you to update conversation log before committing
  - **post-commit hook**: Suggests logging your commit after it's done
  - Non-blocking (doesn't prevent commits)
  - Bypass with `git commit --no-verify`
  - Easy uninstall: `rm .git/hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/post-commit`
  - Example: `npx create-ai-chat-context install-hooks`

### Enhanced

- **`init` command** - Now auto-detects project type

  - No need to specify `--template` for common project types
  - Detects Next.js, Python, Rust automatically
  - Shows detection result with spinner
  - Manual override still works: `--template nextjs`

- **`update` command** - Uses improved detection
  - Refactored to use centralized detection module
  - More reliable template detection
  - Consistent with init command

### Why This Update?

**Problem 1:** Users had to manually specify template type
**Solution:** Auto-detection checks project files and selects the right template

**Problem 2:** Users forget to update conversation log after coding
**Solution:** Git hooks provide gentle reminders at commit time

**Problem 3:** Detection logic was duplicated across commands
**Solution:** Centralized detection module (`src/detect.js`)

### User Experience

**Before v0.6.0:**

```bash
User: npx create-ai-chat-context init
# Uses generic template (not ideal for Next.js project)

User: git commit -m "Add feature"
# No reminder to update log
# Log gets outdated
```

**After v0.6.0:**

```bash
User: npx create-ai-chat-context init
# ‚úì Detected nextjs project
# Uses Next.js template automatically!

User: git commit -m "Add feature"
# üìù Reminder: Update your conversation log!
# Consider running: npx create-ai-chat-context log
# ‚úÖ Commit successful!
```

### Commands Summary

```bash
# Initialize with auto-detection
npx create-ai-chat-context init

# Initialize with manual template (override)
npx create-ai-chat-context init --template python

# Install Git hooks
npx create-ai-chat-context install-hooks

# Install Git hooks (overwrite existing)
npx create-ai-chat-context install-hooks --force

# Uninstall Git hooks
rm .git/hooks/pre-commit
rm .git/hooks/post-commit
```

### Auto-Detection Logic

**Next.js/React:**

- Checks `package.json` for `next` dependency
- Checks `package.json` for `react` dependency (without `next`)
- Uses `nextjs` template

**Python:**

- Checks for `requirements.txt`
- Checks for `pyproject.toml`
- Checks for `setup.py`
- Checks for `Pipfile`
- Checks for `poetry.lock`
- Uses `python` template

**Rust:**

- Checks for `Cargo.toml`
- Uses `rust` template

**Default:**

- Falls back to generic template if no match

### Git Hooks Behavior

**pre-commit hook:**

1. Runs before `git commit`
2. Checks if `.ai/conversation-log.md` was modified
3. If not, shows reminder (but doesn't block commit)
4. Only shows reminder if code files are being committed
5. Suggests: `npx create-ai-chat-context log`

**post-commit hook:**

1. Runs after `git commit`
2. Shows success message
3. Reminds to update knowledge base
4. Shows what was just committed
5. Non-intrusive, just a helpful reminder

### Impact

- ‚úÖ Zero-config initialization (auto-detects project type)
- ‚úÖ Never forget to update log (Git hooks remind you)
- ‚úÖ Better defaults for common project types
- ‚úÖ Consistent detection across commands
- ‚úÖ Non-blocking reminders (doesn't interrupt workflow)
- ‚úÖ Easy to bypass when needed

### Technical Details

**New Module: `src/detect.js`**

- `detectProjectType(cwd)` - Auto-detect from project files
- `detectTemplateFromKB(aiDir)` - Detect from existing KB (for update)
- `getProjectInfo(cwd)` - Get project name and description
- `isNextJsProject(cwd)` - Check for Next.js
- `isPythonProject(cwd)` - Check for Python
- `isRustProject(cwd)` - Check for Rust

**New Module: `src/install-hooks.js`**

- `installGitHooks(options)` - Install pre-commit and post-commit hooks
- `generatePreCommitHook()` - Generate hook script
- `generatePostCommitHook()` - Generate hook script
- Hooks are shell scripts with color output
- Executable permissions set automatically (0o755)

**Refactoring:**

- Moved detection logic from `src/update.js` to `src/detect.js`
- Updated `src/init.js` to use auto-detection
- Updated `src/update.js` to use centralized detection
- Consistent detection behavior across all commands

```

**Continuing from previous chat (RECOMMENDED):**

```
Read .ai-instructions first, and help me continue where we left off with chat #[number].
```

**Best option (most explicit):**

```
Read .ai-instructions first, continue from chat #[number], then help me [specific task].
```
