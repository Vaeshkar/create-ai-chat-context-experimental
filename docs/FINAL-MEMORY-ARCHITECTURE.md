# Final Memory Architecture - AICF-Centric

## 🎯 The Real Goal

**Keep 100% of what we did and talked about in sessions so you don't lose your memory.**

That's it. That's the whole thing.

## 🔄 Memory Dropoff Strategy (Compression Over Time)

### 0-7 Days: FULL DETAIL
- Store in `.aicf/recent/`
- Keep everything: user input, AI output, decisions, issues, tasks, context
- File size: ~5KB per conversation

### 7-30 Days: SUMMARY
- Move to `.aicf/medium/`
- Keep: key decisions, final state, critical issues
- File size: ~1KB per conversation

### 30-90 Days: KEY POINTS
- Move to `.aicf/old/`
- Keep: critical decisions only
- File size: ~200 bytes per conversation

### 90+ Days: SINGLE LINE
- Move to `.aicf/archive/{month}.aicf`
- Format: `date|critical_decision|outcome`
- File size: ~100 bytes per conversation

## 🗑️ Cache Cleanup

```
.cache/llm/augment/chunk-N.json
    ↓
CacheConsolidationAgent processes
    ↓
Writes to .aicf/{conversationId}.aicf
    ↓
DELETE chunk-N.json ✅
```

**Result:** Cache stays clean, no bloat

---

## 📊 Storage Comparison

### Current (Broken)
- 8,000 files in `.aicf/` and `.ai/`
- 4,000+ chunk files in `.cache/`
- ~50MB total
- Scrolling madness
- Conversation data scattered

### New (AICF-Centric)
- ~100 files in `.aicf/recent/` (FULL DETAIL)
- ~200 files in `.aicf/medium/` (SUMMARY)
- ~400 files in `.aicf/old/` (KEY POINTS)
- 1-2 files per month in `.aicf/archive/` (SINGLE LINE)
- 4 files in `.ai/` (static docs only)
- 0 chunk files (deleted after processing)
- ~5MB total
- Easy navigation
- 100% memory preserved in AICF format

---

## ✅ Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Extract Augment Conversations
1. Read 4,063 Augment conversations
2. Write to `.aicf/{conversationId}.aicf` (FULL DETAIL)
3. Append to `.aicf/conversations.aicf` index
4. Delete chunk files
5. Result: 4,063 files in `.aicf/recent/`

### Phase 2: Implement Memory Dropoff
1. Analyze conversation age
2. Compress by age (FULL → SUMMARY → KEY POINTS → SINGLE LINE)
3. Move files to appropriate folders
4. Consolidate ancient conversations into monthly archives
5. Result: Organized, compressed memory

### Phase 3: Cleanup
1. Delete `.ai/conversation-log.md`
2. Delete `.ai/technical-decisions.md`
3. Delete `.ai/known-issues.md`
4. Delete `.ai/next-steps.md`
5. Delete `.ai/{conversationId}.md` files
6. Keep only: code-style.md, design-system.md, npm-publishing-checklist.md, testing-philosophy.md

## 🎯 Why This Works

**AICF is the source of truth for memory:**
- ✅ 100% of conversations preserved
- ✅ Fast read/write (pipe-delimited)
- ✅ AI-optimized format
- ✅ Organized by age
- ✅ Compressed over time
- ✅ No data loss
- ✅ Easy to navigate

**`.ai/` is only for static documentation:**
- ✅ Code style reference
- ✅ Design system reference
- ✅ Publishing checklist
- ✅ Testing philosophy
- ✅ No conversation clutter
