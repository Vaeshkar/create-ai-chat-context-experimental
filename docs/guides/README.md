## The Problem

When working with AI coding assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Cursor, Augment, Warp, etc.), every new chat session loses all context. You have to re-explain your project architecture, technical decisions, why you chose X over Y, what you accomplished in previous sessions, and known issues. This wastes significant time in every chat session.

Unlike other AI context tools that focus on project planning and rules, `create-ai-chat-context` focuses on preserving conversation history and technical decisions across sessions. It works with ALL AI assistants and maintains institutional knowledge through files like `conversation-log.md`, `technical-decisions.md`, and `known-issues.md`.

## Experimental Approach

**Research Goal:** Next-generation AI context management through:

**‚úÖ PROVEN: AICF 3.0 Format**

- Revolutionary 95.5% compression with zero semantic loss
- Structured semantic tags optimized for AI consumption
- Cross-AI compatibility (Claude, GPT, Copilot, Cursor, etc.)

**üöß IN DEVELOPMENT: Advanced Features**

- Automated conversation boundary detection
- Zero-cost logic agent processing
- Real-time context preservation

**Current Focus:** Building on stable `.ai/` knowledge base foundation with revolutionary `.aicf/` compression format.

## üí° Foundation

**Built on proven foundation:** Inherits 32 comprehensive templates from stable version covering all major programming languages and frameworks (JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go, Java, .NET, PHP, Ruby, Mobile, DevOps, AI/ML, Blockchain, GameDev, etc.)

**Experimental additions:** Enhanced with revolutionary AICF 3.0 format research and next-generation automation concepts.

## Experimental Setup

**‚ö†Ô∏è For stable, production use: `npx create-ai-chat-context init`**

**For experimental research:**

```bash
# Clone experimental branch
git clone https://github.com/Vaeshkar/create-ai-chat-context-experimental.git
cd create-ai-chat-context-experimental

# Explore AICF 3.0 format examples
cat .aicf/*.aicf

# Study revolutionary compression
cat BIRTH_OF_AICF_HISTORIC_CONVERSATION.md
```

**Research Focus:** AICF 3.0 format specification and advanced automation concepts.
