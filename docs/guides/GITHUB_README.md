### **Universal AI Memory Protocol**

### Never lose context between AI chat sessions

**🚀 NEW: AICF 2.0 - Aligned with Anthropic's Context Management Vision**

Stop wasting 30+ minutes re-explaining your project to AI assistants every chat session.

## 🎯 **AICF 2.0 - The Future of AI Memory**

On **September 29, 2025**, Anthropic announced [context management features](https://www.anthropic.com/news/context-management) for Claude, including a **memory tool** for persistent storage across conversations.

**We built AICF 2.0 - and made it even better:**

<div align="center">

| Feature                   | Anthropic |  AICF 2.0  |
| :------------------------ | :-------: | :--------: |
| **Token Reduction**       |    84%    | **88%** 🔥 |
| **File-based Memory**     |    ✅     |     ✅     |
| **Persistent Storage**    |    ✅     |     ✅     |
| **Relationship Tracking** |    ❌     | **✅** 🔥  |
| **O(1) Lookup**           |    ❌     | **✅** 🔥  |
| **Works with ALL AIs**    |    ❌     | **✅** 🔥  |

</div>

### **How It Works:**

```bash
# 1. Migrate your knowledge base to AICF format
npx aic migrate

# 2. When your chat fills up, get AI-ready context
npx aic context --ai

# 3. Start new chat, paste context → Full memory instantly! 🪄
```

### **The Magic:**

```
Chat Session 1 (fills up)
    ↓
npx aic context --ai
    ↓
Copy output
    ↓
Chat Session 2 (new)
    ↓
Paste context
    ↓
AI has FULL MEMORY of Session 1! ✨
```

**No more context loss. Ever.** 🚀

---

## 🤔 The Problem

When working with AI coding assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Cursor, Augment, etc.), you face a frustrating issue:

**Every new chat session loses all context.**

You have to re-explain:

- Your project architecture
- Technical decisions you made
- Why you chose X over Y
- What you accomplished in previous sessions
- Known issues and solutions

**This wastes 30+ minutes EVERY chat session.** 😤

---

## ✅ The Solution

`create-ai-chat-context` creates a `.ai/` knowledge base in your project that AI assistants read at the start of each chat.

**Result:** AI gets full context in 2 seconds. No more re-explaining!

### 🤖 AI-Optimized Format (v0.11.1+)

**Why YAML?** AI assistants parse structured data faster and use fewer tokens than natural language.

**Benefits:**

- **52% fewer tokens** for summaries (250 → 120 tokens for 10 chats)
- **47% fewer tokens** per entry (150 → 80 tokens)
- **Instant parsing** - No NLP needed
- **100% accuracy** - Structured data eliminates ambiguity

**Example comparison:**

<table>
<tr>
<th>Traditional Markdown (150 tokens)</th>
<th>AI-Optimized YAML (80 tokens)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```markdown
## Chat #7 - v0.10.0

### What We Did

- Released v0.10.0
- Rewrote chat-finish

### Key Decisions

- Make it automatic
- Users don't want questions
```

</td>
<td>

```yaml
---
CHAT: 7
TYPE: RELEASE
TOPIC: v0.10.0
WHAT:
  - Rewrote chat-finish
WHY:
  - Users don't want questions
OUTCOME: SHIPPED
---
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Result:** Keep 2x more conversation history in AI context windows!

### 🚀 AI-Native Format (AICF) - v0.12.0+

**For Power Users: Maximum Token Efficiency**

The AI-native format is an ultra-compact format designed purely for AI parsing efficiency, not human readability.

**When to use:**

- Large conversation history (50+ chats)
- Hitting context window limits
- Maximum token efficiency needed
- Don't need to manually read logs

**Token Savings:**

- **85% fewer tokens** vs YAML (12 tokens vs 80 tokens per entry)
- **92% fewer tokens** vs prose (150 tokens vs 12 tokens per entry)
- **6x more history** in context windows

**Enable:**

```bash
npx aic config set useAiNativeFormat true
```

**Format:** `C#|YYYYMMDD|T|TOPIC|WHAT|WHY|O|FILES`

**Example:**

```
7|20251001|R|v0.10.0 auto chat-finish|Rewrote chat-finish auto operation|Users no questions after 4hr sessions|S|src/chat-finish.js
```

**Comparison:**

| Format   | Tokens | Example                          |
| -------- | ------ | -------------------------------- |
| Prose    | 150    | Full markdown with sections      |
| YAML     | 80     | Structured YAML with labels      |
| **AICF** | **12** | **Pipe-delimited ultra-compact** |

**Real-World Impact:**

- Claude 3.5 Sonnet (200K): 2,500 entries (YAML) → **16,600 entries (AICF)**
- GPT-4 Turbo (128K): 1,600 entries (YAML) → **10,600 entries (AICF)**

**Backward Compatible:** Supports reading all 3 formats (Markdown, YAML, AICF) simultaneously. Can revert anytime.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd your-project

# Initialize AI knowledge base
npx create-ai-chat-context init

# Customize the files for your project
vim .ai/architecture.md
vim .ai/technical-decisions.md

# Commit to Git
git add .ai/ .ai-instructions NEW_CHAT_PROMPT.md
git commit -m "feat: Add .ai/ knowledge base system"

# In your next AI chat, use this prompt:
"Read .ai-instructions first, then help me with [your task]."
```

**That's it!** AI now has full context. 🎉
