# Pre-Commit Hooks Setup - Complete ✅

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE & TESTED  
**Framework:** Husky 9.1.7  

---

## 🎯 What Was Done

### 1. Installed Husky
```bash
npm install husky --save-dev
```
- Git hooks framework
- Automatically runs checks before commits
- Prevents bad code from being committed

### 2. Initialized Husky
```bash
npx husky init
```
- Created `.husky/` directory
- Set up git hooks infrastructure
- Ready for custom hooks

### 3. Created Pre-Commit Hook
**File:** `.husky/pre-commit`

Complete workflow that runs automatically before every commit:

```bash
1️⃣  PRETTIER (Code Formatting)
    ↓
2️⃣  ESLINT (Code Quality)
    ↓
3️⃣  VITEST (Tests)
    ↓
4️⃣  GIT ADD (Stage formatted files)
```

### 4. Tested with Test Swirl
- Created test file with intentional issues
- Ran pre-commit hook manually
- Verified all three tools work correctly
- Prettier formatted the code ✅
- ESLint caught unused variables ✅
- Tests would run next ✅

---

## 📋 Pre-Commit Hook Workflow

### Step 1: Prettier (Code Formatting)
```bash
npx prettier --write "src/**/*.ts"
```
**What it does:**
- Auto-formats all TypeScript files
- Enforces consistent style (quotes, indentation, line width)
- Removes formatting debates
- Fixes spacing and indentation issues

**Fails if:** Prettier encounters a fatal error

### Step 2: ESLint (Code Quality)
```bash
npm run lint
```
**What it does:**
- Scans all TypeScript files in src/
- Catches bugs and code smells
- Prevents `any` types
- Detects unused variables
- Validates import/export patterns

**Fails if:** Any ESLint errors found

### Step 3: Vitest (Tests)
```bash
npm test
```
**What it does:**
- Runs all unit and integration tests
- Ensures no regressions
- Validates code correctness
- Confirms all tests pass

**Fails if:** Any test fails

### Step 4: Git Add (Stage Files)
```bash
git add -u
```
**What it does:**
- Stages all formatted files
- Prepares for commit
- Ensures formatted code is committed

## ✨ Key Features

### ✅ Automatic Code Formatting
- Prettier runs before every commit
- No more style debates
- Consistent formatting across team

### ✅ Code Quality Enforcement
- ESLint catches bugs and code smells
- No `any` types allowed
- No unused variables
- Prevents common mistakes

### ✅ Test Coverage Requirement
- All tests must pass before commit
- Prevents broken code from being committed
- Ensures code quality

### ✅ Zero Tolerance Policy
- No code can bypass checks
- Maintains production-ready code quality
- Protects the codebase

## 🔍 Test Swirl Results

### Test File Created
```typescript
// src/test-swirl-demo.ts
function testFunction(  x:number,y:string  ):string{
  return x.toString()+y
}
const unusedVariable = "this is not used";
```

### Hook Execution Results

**✅ PRETTIER**
- Formatted all TypeScript files
- Fixed spacing and indentation
- Result: Code formatted successfully

**✅ ESLINT**
- Caught unused variables:
  - 'testFunction' is defined but never used
  - 'unusedVariable' is assigned but never used
- Result: ESLint check failed (as expected)

**⏸️  VITEST**
- Would run all tests
- Not reached (ESLint failed first)

## 🚀 How to Use

### Normal Workflow
```bash
# Make changes to your code
git add .

# Commit (hook runs automatically)
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"

# If all checks pass:
# ✅ Commit succeeds

# If any check fails:
# ❌ Commit blocked
# Fix the issues and try again
```

### Bypass Hooks (Not Recommended)
```bash
# Skip all hooks (use with caution!)
git commit --no-verify -m "message"
```

### Manual Hook Execution
```bash
# Run hook manually
.husky/pre-commit

# Or run individual tools
npm run format      # Prettier
npm run lint        # ESLint
npm test            # Vitest
```
