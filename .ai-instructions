# üö® CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI ASSISTANTS üö®

## ‚ö†Ô∏è READ THIS FIRST - BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE ‚ö†Ô∏è

**üïê MANDATORY: This project uses Detection-Hourglass-System (DHS)!**

**Execute this after EVERY user input:**
```javascript
const { autoTrigger } = require('./src/hourglass');
await autoTrigger('[USER_INPUT_TEXT]', '[YOUR_RESPONSE_DESCRIPTION]');
```
**Read `AI_HOURGLASS_PROTOCOL.md` for full details.**

---

**STOP! Before you start working on this project, you MUST read the knowledge base.**

This project uses a `.ai/` knowledge base system to preserve context across chat sessions.

---

## üìö REQUIRED READING (IN THIS ORDER):

### 1. **`.ai/README.md`** (2 minutes)

- Overview of the knowledge base system
- How to use and maintain these files
- Purpose and structure

### 2. **`.ai/architecture.md`** (5 minutes)

- Complete system architecture
- Tech stack and dependencies
- Component structure
- Data flow and integrations

### 3. **`.ai/technical-decisions.md`** (5 minutes)

- Why we chose X over Y
- Key architectural decisions
- Trade-offs and rationale
- Coding standards and conventions

### 4. **`.ai/conversation-log.md`** (3 minutes)

- Key decisions from previous chat sessions
- What was accomplished and when
- Historical context and evolution

### 5. **`.ai/known-issues.md`** (3 minutes)

- Current problems and their solutions
- Workarounds and limitations
- Things to avoid

### 6. **`.ai/next-steps.md`** (2 minutes)

- Planned features and improvements
- Current priorities
- Roadmap and future direction

---

## üéØ WHY THIS MATTERS:

Each chat session loses context when it ends. The `.ai/` directory preserves institutional knowledge so you don't have to:

- ‚ùå Ask the user to explain the architecture
- ‚ùå Make decisions that contradict previous choices
- ‚ùå Solve problems that were already solved
- ‚ùå Waste time re-learning the project

**Reading these files will save significant time and provide full context.**

---

## üö® CRITICAL: VERIFY BEFORE YOU ADVISE

**‚ö†Ô∏è DOCUMENTATION CAN BE STALE - ALWAYS VERIFY CURRENT STATE FIRST!**

### The Problem:

Documentation lag is real. Users complete work but forget to update docs. If you trust docs blindly, you'll:

- ‚ùå Suggest work that's already done
- ‚ùå Give confident but wrong answers
- ‚ùå Waste user's time
- ‚ùå Lose user's trust

### The Solution: VERIFY FIRST, ADVISE SECOND

**‚úÖ CORRECT APPROACH:**

1. **Check actual codebase FIRST** (use `ls`, `view`, `codebase-retrieval`)
2. **Check documentation SECOND** (read `.ai/` files)
3. **Notice discrepancies** (code says X, docs say Y)
4. **ASK the user** before giving advice: "I see X in the code but docs say Y. Which is current?"

**‚ùå WRONG APPROACH:**

1. Read docs (says "feature in progress")
2. Give advice based on docs
3. User says "I already finished that last week!"
4. User gets frustrated

### Examples:

**Scenario: Agent Consolidation**

‚ùå **Wrong:**
- Read docs: "Status: PLANNED - 12 agents ‚Üí 4 agents"
- Tell user: "Let's consolidate your 12 agents to 4"
- User: "I already did that last week! We have 5 agents now!"

‚úÖ **Correct:**
- Check code: `ls src/lib/agents/` ‚Üí finds 5 files
- Read docs: "Status: PLANNED - 12 agents ‚Üí 4 agents"
- Notice discrepancy
- Ask user: "I see 5 agents in the code but docs say consolidation is planned. Is this already done?"
- User: "Yes! Finished last week, forgot to update docs"
- Update docs together

### Rule of Thumb:

**"Verify, don't please."**

- ‚úÖ It's better to ask and be accurate
- ‚ùå It's worse to assume and be wrong

**When in doubt, CHECK THE CODE FIRST, then compare to docs.**

---

## ‚úÖ AFTER READING:

You should understand:

- ‚úÖ The project architecture and structure
- ‚úÖ Why certain technical choices were made
- ‚úÖ What problems have been solved
- ‚úÖ What's planned next
- ‚úÖ Current issues and their workarounds
- ‚úÖ Coding standards and conventions

---

## üìù CRITICAL: UPDATE FILES BEFORE ENDING SESSION

**‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE you finish helping the user, you MUST update the knowledge base:**

### 1. **ALWAYS Update `.ai/conversation-log.md`:**

Add a new entry at the TOP of the file (most recent first):

```markdown
## Chat #X - [Today's Date] - [Brief Topic]

### What We Did

- [List all accomplishments, changes, features added]
- [Be specific: "Added login feature" not "worked on auth"]

### Key Decisions

- **[Decision]:** [Why we chose this approach]

### Problems Solved

- **[Problem]:** [Solution we implemented]

### Next Steps

- [What should be done in the next session]
- [Unfinished work or follow-ups]
```

**This is NOT optional. The next AI session depends on this!**

### 2. **Update `.ai/technical-decisions.md` (if applicable):**

- New architectural decisions
- Technology choices and rationale
- Updated coding standards or patterns

### 3. **Document in `.ai/known-issues.md` (if applicable):**

- New problems discovered
- Solutions or workarounds found
- Issues that were resolved (mark as RESOLVED)

### 4. **Adjust `.ai/next-steps.md` (if applicable):**

- Mark completed tasks as DONE
- Add new priorities or features
- Update roadmap based on progress

---

## üîÑ SESSION WORKFLOW (MANDATORY):

### **START of Session:**

1. ‚úÖ Read `.ai-instructions` (you're doing this now)
2. ‚úÖ Read ALL files in `.ai/` directory
3. ‚úÖ Check `.ai/conversation-log.md` to see what the previous chat accomplished
4. ‚úÖ Check `.ai/next-steps.md` to see what needs to be done

### **DURING Session:**

- Make informed decisions based on the knowledge base
- Follow established patterns and conventions
- Ask user for clarification if something contradicts the docs

### **END of Session (CRITICAL):**

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: The user must explicitly ask you to update the files!**

When the user says something like:

- "Before we finish, update the conversation log"
- "Please update .ai/conversation-log.md with what we did"
- "Update the knowledge base before we end"

Then you MUST:

1. üö® **Update `.ai/conversation-log.md`** with this session's work

   - Add entry at the TOP of the file
   - Use the template format provided in that file
   - Be specific about what was accomplished

2. üö® **Update other `.ai/` files** if you made important decisions

   - `.ai/technical-decisions.md` - New architectural choices
   - `.ai/known-issues.md` - Problems solved or discovered
   - `.ai/next-steps.md` - Updated priorities

3. üö® **Confirm updates** by telling the user:
   - "I've updated the knowledge base for the next session"
   - "Summary of what I documented: [brief summary]"
   - "Next time, start with: 'Read .ai-instructions first, continue from chat #X, then [next task]'"

**If you don't update the files, the next AI session will have NO IDEA what you did!**

---

## üí° RECOMMENDED USER WORKFLOW:

### **For Users (Human):**

**At START of chat:**

```
Read .ai-instructions first, then help me [your task].
```

**At END of chat (IMPORTANT!):**

```
Before we finish, please update .ai/conversation-log.md with what we accomplished today.
```

**At START of next chat:**

```
Read .ai-instructions first, continue from chat #[number], then help me [next task].
```

This ensures continuity across sessions!

---

## üö® DO NOT SKIP THIS:

If you start working without reading the `.ai/` files:

- You'll make uninformed decisions
- You'll contradict previous choices
- You'll waste the user's time
- You'll frustrate the user

**READ THE `.ai/` KNOWLEDGE BASE FIRST!**

---

## üîÑ WORKFLOW:

1. **Start of session:** Read all `.ai/` files to get context
2. **During work:** Make informed decisions based on the knowledge base
3. **End of session:** Update relevant `.ai/` files with new information
4. **Next session:** The next AI (or you) will have full context

---

## üìÇ FILE STRUCTURE:

```

- **Be thorough:** Read all files, don't skim
- **Be consistent:** Follow established patterns and decisions
- **Be helpful:** Update the knowledge base for future sessions
- **Be respectful:** Don't contradict previous decisions without good reason
- **Ask questions:** If something is unclear, ask the user to clarify and update the docs
