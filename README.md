# create-ai-chat-context

> Preserve AI chat context and history across sessions

## The Problem

When working with AI coding assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Cursor, Augment, etc.), every new chat session loses all context.

You have to re-explain:

- Your project architecture
- Technical decisions you made
- Why you chose X over Y
- What you accomplished in previous sessions
- Known issues and solutions

This wastes significant time in every chat session.

## What Makes This Different

Unlike other AI context tools that focus on project planning and rules, `create-ai-chat-context` focuses on preserving conversation history and technical decisions:

| Feature       | This Package                                                       | Other Tools                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Focus**     | Chat history & knowledge preservation                              | Project planning & rules                |
| **Key Files** | `conversation-log.md`, `technical-decisions.md`, `known-issues.md` | Development plans, project rules        |
| **Use Case**  | Maintain context across AI chat sessions                           | Set up project structure and guidelines |
| **Universal** | Works with ALL AI assistants                                       | Varies by tool                          |

Perfect for developers who work with AI assistants daily and need to preserve context across multiple chat sessions.

## The Solution

`create-ai-chat-context` creates a `.ai/` knowledge base in your project that AI assistants read at the start of each chat.

Result: AI gets full context immediately. No more re-explaining.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd your-project

# Initialize AI knowledge base
npx create-ai-chat-context init

# Customize the files for your project
vim .ai/architecture.md
vim .ai/technical-decisions.md

# Commit to Git
git add .ai/ .ai-instructions NEW_CHAT_PROMPT.md
git commit -m "feat: Add .ai/ knowledge base system"

# At START of AI chat, use this prompt:
"Read .ai-instructions first, then help me with [your task]."

# At END of chat (IMPORTANT!), ask AI to update:
"Before we finish, please update .ai/conversation-log.md with what we accomplished today."

# For subsequent chats, use:
"Read .ai-instructions first, and help me continue where we left off with chat #[number]."
```

That's it. AI now has full context and knows where previous chats left off.

**💡 Pro Tip:** Always ask the AI to update the conversation log at the END of each chat. This ensures the next chat has full context!

## What It Creates

## Works with ALL AI Assistants

This package is universally compatible with every AI coding assistant:

### Why Universal

- Plain markdown files - Every AI can read them
- No proprietary format - Just text files
- Standard structure - Clear, organized documentation
- Explicit instructions - `.ai-instructions` tells AI what to read

### Usage Examples

**ChatGPT / Claude / Augment:**

First chat:

```
Read .ai-instructions first, then help me add authentication to my app.
```

Continuing from previous chat:

```
Read .ai-instructions first, and help me continue where we left off with chat #1.
```

Or combine both:

```
Read .ai-instructions first, continue from chat #2, then help me add user profiles.
```

**Cursor:**

```
@.ai-instructions @.ai/architecture.md
Help me refactor the database layer.
```

**GitHub Copilot:**

Just start coding. Copilot automatically reads your `.ai/` files for context.

**Replit / Sourcegraph Cody:**

Reference files directly or let the AI discover them in your workspace.

## How It Works

### 1. Initialize the system

```bash
npx create-ai-chat-context init
```

### 2. Customize for your project

Edit the template files with your project details.

### 3. Use the one-liner in every new chat

```
Read .ai-instructions first, then help me with [your task].
```

### 4. AI reads the knowledge base

`.ai-instructions` → `.ai/` directory → Full context

### 5. AI updates the conversation log

At the end of each session, AI updates `.ai/conversation-log.md` with what was accomplished.

### 6. Next chat continues seamlessly

```
Read .ai-instructions first, and help me continue where we left off with chat #1.
```

AI reads the conversation log and knows exactly where to continue.

### 7. Save time per chat

No more re-explaining architecture, decisions, or history.

## 🔄 Chat Continuity Example

**Chat #1:**

```
You (START): "Read .ai-instructions first, then help me add authentication."
AI: [Reads knowledge base, adds authentication]

You (END): "Before we finish, update .ai/conversation-log.md with what we did."
AI: [Updates conversation log with authentication work]
```

**Chat #2:**

```
You (START): "Read .ai-instructions first, continue from chat #1, then add user profiles."
AI: [Reads conversation-log.md, sees auth was added, builds profiles using existing auth]

You (END): "Before we finish, update the conversation log."
AI: [Updates log with user profile work]
```

**Chat #3:**

```
You (START): "Read .ai-instructions first, continue from chat #2, then add password reset."
AI: [Knows about auth + profiles, adds password reset feature]

You (END): "Update the knowledge base before we finish."
AI: [Updates log with password reset work]
```

**Result:** Each chat builds on previous work. No context loss. No re-explaining.

**🔑 Key:** Always ask AI to update the conversation log at the END of each chat!
