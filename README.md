## The Problem

When working with AI coding assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Cursor, Augment, Warp, etc.), every new chat session loses all context. You have to re-explain your project architecture, technical decisions, why you chose X over Y, what you accomplished in previous sessions, and known issues. This wastes significant time in every chat session.

Unlike other AI context tools that focus on project planning and rules, `create-ai-chat-context` focuses on preserving conversation history and technical decisions across sessions. It works with ALL AI assistants and maintains institutional knowledge through files like `conversation-log.md`, `technical-decisions.md`, and `known-issues.md`.

## Experimental Approach

**Research Goal:** Next-generation AI context management through:

**‚úÖ PROVEN: AICF 3.0 Format**
- Revolutionary 95.5% compression with zero semantic loss
- Structured semantic tags optimized for AI consumption
- Cross-AI compatibility (Claude, GPT, Copilot, Cursor, etc.)

**üöß IN DEVELOPMENT: Advanced Features**
- Automated conversation boundary detection
- Zero-cost logic agent processing
- Real-time context preservation

**Current Focus:** Building on stable `.ai/` knowledge base foundation with revolutionary `.aicf/` compression format.

## üí° Foundation

**Built on proven foundation:** Inherits 32 comprehensive templates from stable version covering all major programming languages and frameworks (JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go, Java, .NET, PHP, Ruby, Mobile, DevOps, AI/ML, Blockchain, GameDev, etc.)

**Experimental additions:** Enhanced with revolutionary AICF 3.0 format research and next-generation automation concepts.


## Experimental Setup

**‚ö†Ô∏è For stable, production use: `npx create-ai-chat-context init`**

**For experimental research:**
```bash
# Clone experimental branch
git clone https://github.com/Vaeshkar/create-ai-chat-context-experimental.git
cd create-ai-chat-context-experimental

# Explore AICF 3.0 format examples
cat .aicf/*.aicf

# Study revolutionary compression
cat BIRTH_OF_AICF_HISTORIC_CONVERSATION.md
```

**Research Focus:** AICF 3.0 format specification and advanced automation concepts.

## Research Areas

**Current experimental research includes:**
- AICF 3.0 format specification and implementation
- Automated conversation boundary detection algorithms  
- Zero-cost logic agent processing concepts
- Cross-AI compatibility optimization
- Revolutionary compression techniques (95.5% achieved)

**For working commands, use the stable version:** `npx create-ai-chat-context init`


## üß™ Experimental Research Areas

**Current Research Focus:** Next-generation AI context automation

### üïê Detection-Hourglass-System (DHS) - Concept

**Research Goal:** Auto-detect conversation boundaries for seamless context preservation

**Theoretical Approach:**
- Investigate AI code execution as trigger mechanism
- Explore universal compatibility across AI platforms
- Design natural conversation chunk detection
- Zero-cost, logic-based boundary detection

**Status:** Early conceptual research phase

## ü§ñ Logic Agent Research

**Research Concept:** Zero-cost local processing for AI context management

### Theoretical Benefits Over AI Compression

| Aspect | AI Compression | Logic Agent Approach |
|--------|---------------|-----------------------|
| **Cost** | $0.03-0.15 per checkpoint | $0.00 (theoretical) |
| **Speed** | 30-45 seconds | Near-instant (concept) |
| **Information Preserved** | 60-75% | Target: 95%+ |
| **API Dependency** | Required | None (local processing) |
| **Vendor Lock-in** | Yes | Platform agnostic |

**Conceptual Architecture:** 6 specialized processing units:
- **ConversationParser** - Extract conversation structure
- **DecisionExtractor** - Identify key decision points
- **InsightAnalyzer** - Capture breakthrough moments
- **StateTracker** - Monitor project progression
- **FileWriter** - Output to dual formats
- **MemoryManager** - Intelligent data lifecycle

**Status:** Research and prototyping phase

## üåç AICF: A Vision for Universal AI Memory

We believe **AICF (AI Continuity Format)** represents the future of AI memory persistence. Our vision is for `.aicf` to become a **widely-adopted standard** across the tech industry.

### Why AICF Should Be Universal:

üéØ **Built for AI, by AI** - Designed specifically for optimal AI comprehension and processing

‚ö° **Ultra-efficient** - 85% token reduction while preserving 100% information integrity

üîó **Relationship mapping** - CONTEXT_REFS and IMPACT_SCORE enable intelligent prioritization

üèóÔ∏è **Structured intelligence** - Schema-based format with confidence scoring and temporal tracking

üåê **Universal compatibility** - Works with any AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Cursor, Warp, etc.)

üí∞ **Zero cost** - No API dependencies, works completely offline

### The Future We Envision:

- **IDEs** natively support `.aicf` files for AI context
- **AI platforms** adopt AICF as standard memory format  
- **Development teams** share project context through `.aicf` files
- **Open source projects** include `.aicf/` directories for contributor onboarding
- **AI tools** interoperate seamlessly using AICF format

**Join the movement!** Help us make AICF the universal standard for AI memory by:
- ‚≠ê Starring this project on GitHub
- üì¢ Sharing AICF with your development teams
- üîß Contributing to the AICF specification
- üí° Building tools that support AICF format

*Together, we can solve AI context loss forever.* üöÄ

## Configuration

Optional configuration for customizing the tool:

```bash
# View current configuration
npx aic config

# Set preferred AI model for token reports (optional)
npx aic config set preferredModel "Claude Sonnet 4.5"
```

**Configuration is stored per-project** in `.ai/config.json`. See [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md) for details.
