## üîí Data Access & Permissions

### How Permissions Work

When you run `aice init --automatic`, you explicitly select which LLM platforms to monitor:

```
üìÅ Data Discovery
To set up automatic mode, we need your permission to:
  ‚Ä¢ Read conversations from your LLM library folders
  ‚Ä¢ Extract and consolidate them into memory files
  ‚Ä¢ Store them locally in .aicf/ and .ai/ directories

? Which LLM platforms do you use? (Select all that apply)
  ‚òê Augment
  ‚òê Warp
  ‚òê Claude Desktop
  ‚òê Claude CLI
  ‚òê Copilot
  ‚òê ChatGPT
```

**You choose. You control. You decide.**

### Platform-Specific Access

| Platform | Location | Access Type | Data Read |
|----------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Augment** | `.cache/llm/augment/` | Read-only JSON | Conversation chunks |
| **Warp** | `~/Library/Group Containers/.../warp.sqlite` | Read-only SQLite | AI queries & responses |
| **Claude Desktop** | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/` | Read-only DB | Conversation history |
| **Claude CLI** | `~/.claude/projects/` | Read-only JSONL | Session files |
| **Copilot** | `~/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Copilot/` | Read-only files | Conversation history |
| **ChatGPT** | Browser storage | Read-only | Conversation history |

**All access is read-only. We never modify your LLM data.**

## üìã Consent & Audit Trail

### Permissions File: `.aicf/.permissions.aicf`

Every permission is recorded with timestamp and consent type:

```
@PERMISSIONS|version=1.0|format=aicf
@PLATFORM|name=augment|status=active|consent=explicit|timestamp=2025-10-24T11:31:15.268Z
@PLATFORM|name=warp|status=active|consent=explicit|timestamp=2025-10-24T11:31:15.269Z
@PLATFORM|name=claude-desktop|status=active|consent=explicit|timestamp=2025-10-24T11:31:15.270Z
@AUDIT|event=init|timestamp=2025-10-24T11:31:15.270Z|user=system|action=created_permissions_file
```

**You can audit exactly what permissions were granted and when.**

### Manage Permissions Anytime

```bash
# View all permissions
aice permissions list

# Revoke access to a platform
aice permissions revoke warp

# Grant access to a platform
aice permissions grant warp
```

**Revoke permissions instantly. No data is accessed from revoked platforms.**

## üóëÔ∏è Data Deletion

### What Gets Stored

When the tool processes conversations, it stores:

- `.aicf/` - AI-optimized structured data (pipe-delimited format)
- `.ai/` - Human-readable markdown documentation
- `.watcher-config.json` - Configuration (which platforms to monitor)
- `.permissions.aicf` - Permission audit trail

### Delete Your Data

```bash
# Delete all memory files
rm -rf .aicf/ .ai/

# Delete watcher config
rm .watcher-config.json

# Delete permissions audit trail
rm .aicf/.permissions.aicf
```

**You own your data. Delete it anytime.**
