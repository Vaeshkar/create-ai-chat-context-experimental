This is and remains important next to the conversation-log.md and technical-decisions.md. And you can have a .json file that also need to have a system that doesn't become endless. The whole tought of the aicf is that you have a faster access to this data. I don't mind the file size, it was for quicker, token reduced data reading. That is why aicf is there. It is not yet an official file type. What do you think? How would this .json dumping evolve into a good system that doesn'T become overwhelming and not clean or cleaned up from time to time. We ahve a memorydropoff.js that could be used for that also.",
