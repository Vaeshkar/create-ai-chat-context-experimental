Then we went to the hourglass detections and updated the agents to work with chunk_#.json and try to find a solution on detection. We have a detection but for terminal movement that as only limited information. We can also get extra information from the changed git diff files. But the most valueble information is happening here between you and me. To extract this without manually writing: update the .ai and .aicf files. is a hard nut to crack. Isn't there a way for the detection system to inform you to context_dump the session information you responded and we can take that data off you and give it to the agents to convert into the .ai and .aicf files? That is the missing link. The detection system is there, just need to inform the AI to do so. As the AI informed us with \"AI Terminal\" now we need to communicate the other way around: \"Hourglass is full turn it\" and the 100% full data dump from the warp interface. lets think some more.",
