# Next Steps

Roadmap and priorities for your project.

## ðŸŽ¯ HIGH PRIORITY

### v2.0.0 Current State Management

- [x] **v2.0.0 Published and Live** âœ…
  - Package published to npm successfully
  - Detection-Hourglass-System (DHS) breakthrough achieved
  - Universal AI compatibility proven
  - 32 comprehensive templates available

- [ ] **Manual Workflow Refinement** (Current Focus - Validated by Rubber Duck Analysis ðŸ¦†)
  - **âœ… Confirmed:** Manual approach is superior to automation
  - **âœ… Validated:** "AI, update the .ai and .aicf files" works with every LLM
  - **Priority:** Document this as the official stable workflow
  - **Focus:** Keep what works, build new systems in parallel
  - **Next:** Create README files for both .ai and .aicf folders explaining the process

## ðŸ”¥ Immediate (This Week) - OLD (May be outdated)

### AICF 3.0 Design and Implementation (CRITICAL PRIORITY)

- [ ] **Write AICF 3.0 specification in architecture.md**

  - Document AI-native memory format design
  - Specify @FLOW, @DETAILS, @INSIGHTS, @DECISIONS, @STATE sections
  - Define pipe-delimited format structure
  - Include example checkpoints

- [ ] **Implement every-50-messages checkpoint mechanism**

  - Build message counter
  - Create automatic trigger at message 50, 100, 150, etc.
  - Build conversation analyzer to extract flow, insights, decisions, state
  - Implement append-only write to `.aicf/conversations.aicf`

- [ ] **Test checkpoint format with current conversation (Chat #13)**

  - Manually create checkpoint of Chat #13
  - Verify 70% detail preservation
  - Test that new AI can read checkpoint and continue seamlessly
  - Validate compression ratio (10,000 tokens â†’ 500-600 tokens)

- [ ] **Build value detection algorithm**
  - Implement CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, NOISE classification
  - Test with semantic markers ("key insight", "we decided", etc.)
  - Validate accuracy with real conversation data

### v0.14.1 Testing and Feedback

- [ ] Test v0.14.1 in real projects (removed log command, updated stats/help)
- [ ] Gather user feedback on current workflow
- [ ] Monitor npm downloads and GitHub stars

## ðŸ“… Short-term (This Month)

### AICF 3.0 Implementation

- [ ] **Build @FLOW, @DETAILS, @INSIGHTS, @DECISIONS, @STATE generators**

  - Create conversation flow analyzer
  - Build detail expander (prevents "jist" problem)
  - Implement insight extractor (key realizations)
  - Build decision tracker (what + why)
  - Create state tracker (done, in progress, blocked)

- [ ] **Create migration tool from Markdown to AICF 3.0**

  - Parse conversation-log.md entries
  - Extract technical-decisions.md content
  - Convert to structured detail format
  - Validate zero information loss

- [ ] **Test with toy store project data**

  - Migrate 24 conversations
  - Migrate 10+ decisions
  - Verify 70% detail preservation
  - Compare with AICF 2.0 results (0 conversations, 1 decision)

- [ ] **Design for Anthropic Memory Tool compatibility**
  - Research Anthropic's `/memories` directory format
  - Design AICF to be compatible with Memory Tool
  - Position AICF as universal standard

### Tool Improvements

- [ ] Add more AI models as they're released
- [ ] Add validation for config values
- [ ] Add `config reset` command to restore defaults

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Long-term (This Quarter)

- [ ] Additional templates (Rust, API, Mobile)
- [ ] VS Code extension (optional)
- [ ] Advanced search with filters
- [ ] Team collaboration features
- [ ] Analytics dashboard
- [ ] AI-powered summarization with API integration

---

## ðŸ’¡ Ideas / Backlog

- Make "popular models" list configurable
- Add `npx aic doctor` command for health checks
- Add `npx aic diff` to compare knowledge base versions
- Add support for custom AI models (local LLMs)
- Add `npx aic backup` and `npx aic restore` commands
- Integration with more AI tools (Windsurf, Zed, etc.)
- Add telemetry (opt-in) to understand usage patterns
- Create video tutorials for common workflows
- Add `npx aic migrate` for upgrading old knowledge bases
