**2025-10-03 - Chat #17:**

- ✅ **SHIPPED v1.0.0** - Successfully published to npm
- ✅ **Simplified to 7 essential files** - Reduced complexity for v1.0.0 users
- ✅ **Updated ALL documentation** - README.md, CHANGELOG.md, COMMANDS.md, package.json, docs/
- ✅ **Removed chat-finish command** - Replaced with manual "ask AI to update files" workflow

**2025-10-03 - Chat #16:**

- ✅ Created `.aicf/` template folder with 4 files
- ✅ Updated `init.js` to create both `.ai/` (11 files) and `.aicf/` (4 files)
- ✅ Improved init checks to verify individual files
- ✅ Added 3 missing `.ai/` templates (design-system, code-style, project-overview)
- ✅ Created new `migrate.js` command for existing users
- ✅ Removed `chat-finish` command from CLI
- ✅ Tested `aic init` and `aic migrate` successfully

**2025-10-03 - Chat #15:**

- ✅ Deleted all abandoned automated compression code
- ✅ Removed heavy dependencies (@anthropic-ai/sdk, openai, @openai/agents)
- ✅ Updated package.json to v1.0.0
- ✅ Cleaned up CLI (removed checkpoint commands)

  - Delete unused AI IDE integration files (cursor.js, copilot.js, claude-project.js?)
  - Delete unused format conversion files (convert.js, aicf-migrate.js, aicf-compiler.js?)
  - Keep essential files (init.js, migrate.js, tokens.js, stats.js, summary.js, check.js, validate.js)
  - Keep only essential features for v1.0.0

### Prepare for v1.0.0 Release

- [ ] **Update documentation**

  - Update README.md with v1.0.0 information
  - Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes
  - Verify all commands work

- [ ] **Test package locally**

  - `npm link` and test in another project
  - Verify `npx create-ai-chat-context init` works
  - Check package size is reasonable

- [ ] **Publish v1.0.0**
  - `git tag v1.0.0`
  - `git push origin main --tags`
  - `npm publish`

---

## 🔥 Immediate (This Week) - OLD (May be outdated)

### AICF 3.0 Design and Implementation (CRITICAL PRIORITY)

- [ ] **Write AICF 3.0 specification in architecture.md**

  - Document AI-native memory format design
  - Specify @FLOW, @DETAILS, @INSIGHTS, @DECISIONS, @STATE sections
  - Define pipe-delimited format structure
  - Include example checkpoints

- [ ] **Implement every-50-messages checkpoint mechanism**

  - Build message counter
  - Create automatic trigger at message 50, 100, 150, etc.
  - Build conversation analyzer to extract flow, insights, decisions, state
  - Implement append-only write to `.aicf/conversations.aicf`

- [ ] **Test checkpoint format with current conversation (Chat #13)**

  - Manually create checkpoint of Chat #13
  - Verify 70% detail preservation
  - Test that new AI can read checkpoint and continue seamlessly
  - Validate compression ratio (10,000 tokens → 500-600 tokens)

- [ ] **Build value detection algorithm**
  - Implement CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, NOISE classification
  - Test with semantic markers ("key insight", "we decided", etc.)
  - Validate accuracy with real conversation data

### v0.14.1 Testing and Feedback

- [ ] Test v0.14.1 in real projects (removed log command, updated stats/help)
- [ ] Gather user feedback on current workflow
- [ ] Monitor npm downloads and GitHub stars

---

## 📅 Short-term (This Month)

### AICF 3.0 Implementation

- [ ] **Build @FLOW, @DETAILS, @INSIGHTS, @DECISIONS, @STATE generators**

  - Create conversation flow analyzer
  - Build detail expander (prevents "jist" problem)
  - Implement insight extractor (key realizations)
  - Build decision tracker (what + why)
  - Create state tracker (done, in progress, blocked)

- [ ] **Create migration tool from Markdown to AICF 3.0**

  - Parse conversation-log.md entries
  - Extract technical-decisions.md content
  - Convert to structured detail format
  - Validate zero information loss

- [ ] **Test with toy store project data**

  - Migrate 24 conversations
  - Migrate 10+ decisions
  - Verify 70% detail preservation
  - Compare with AICF 2.0 results (0 conversations, 1 decision)

- [ ] **Design for Anthropic Memory Tool compatibility**
  - Research Anthropic's `/memories` directory format
  - Design AICF to be compatible with Memory Tool
  - Position AICF as universal standard

### Tool Improvements

- [ ] Add more AI models as they're released
- [ ] Add validation for config values
- [ ] Add `config reset` command to restore defaults

---

## 🎯 Long-term (This Quarter)

- [ ] Additional templates (Rust, API, Mobile)
- [ ] VS Code extension (optional)
- [ ] Advanced search with filters
- [ ] Team collaboration features

- Add `npx aic doctor` command for health checks
- Add `npx aic diff` to compare knowledge base versions
- Add support for custom AI models (local LLMs)
- Add `npx aic backup` and `npx aic restore` commands
- Integration with more AI tools (Windsurf, Zed, etc.)
- Add telemetry (opt-in) to understand usage patterns
- Create video tutorials for common workflows
- Add `npx aic migrate` for upgrading old knowledge bases
